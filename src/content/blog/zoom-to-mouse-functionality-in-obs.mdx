While paid tools like [Screen Studio](https://screen.studio/) offer this capability, what if you could achieve the same effect for free? The good news is that you can, using OBS Studio!

In this guide, I'll walk you through the steps to set up zoom-to-mouse functionality. These instructions have been tested on Windows and Mac, and the process should be quite similar for Linux users.

## 1. Download the Magical Script

To get started, you’ll need to download the script that enables the zoom-to-mouse functionality in OBS Studio

- Open this [link](https://github.com/BlankSourceCode/obs-zoom-to-mouse/releases/tag/v1.0.1).
- In the _Assets_ section, click to download the `obs-zoom-to-mouse.lua` file.

## 2. Set Up Your OBS Screen

Now that you have the script, let’s set up your OBS scene:

- Launch OBS.
- Add a **New Scene** by clicking the **+** button under the _Scenes_ section.
- Next, add a **New Source**:
  - On **Mac**, select `macOS Screen Capture` as the source.
  - On **Windows**, choose `Display Capture` as the source.

Important: Not all sources work with this script, so ensure you pick the right one.

## 3. Setup the zoom to mouse script

Now let’s connect the script to your scene:

- Click **Tools** in the top menu bar.
- Select **Scripts** from the dropdown.
- In the _Scripts_ tab, click the plus icon (+) to add the `obs-zoom-to-mouse.lua` script.
- On the right side, you’ll see configuration options. Choose the **Zoom Source** you created earlier (if you can’t find it, click _Refresh zoom sources_).

You can adjust the configuration to your liking, but to match the result from my video, here’s the setup:

**Tip for Mac Retina Displays**: If you're on a Mac with a retina display, you might experience some weird behavior with zoom-to-mouse. To fix this, check the option for **Set Manual Source Position** and refer to the [issue discussion](https://github.com/BlankSourceCode/obs-zoom-to-mouse/issues/24) for more details.

For a smoother experience on Retina displays, you can adjust the `Scale X` and `Scale Y` to `2`, and make sure to set the `Monitor Width` and `Monitor Height` based on your screen resolution. Here's my configuration for reference:

## 4. Setup OBS Hotkey

To control the zoom-to-mouse functionality, you’ll need to configure some hotkeys:

- Go to **Settings** in OBS.
- Navigate to the **Hotkeys** section in the left sidebar.
- Search for **Toggle zoom to mouse** and **Toggle follow mouse during zoom**.
- Assign your preferred hotkeys (I recommend `1` and `2` for easy access).

### Setup Global Hotkeys (Mac Only)

For now the hotkeys are only active when OBS is in focus. If you want to use the hotkeys while working in other applications, you need to set up global hotkeys:

- Enable Accessibility Permissions

  - Open **System Settings**.
  - Navigate to **Privacy & Security** in the sidebar.
  - Click on **Accessibility**.
  - Add OBS to the list of apps that can control your computer.
  - Toggle the switch to enable the app.

- Allow Input Monitoring

  - Back in the **Privacy & Security** tab, select **Input Monitoring**.
  - Add OBS to the list of apps that can monitor input.
  - Toggle the switch to enable the app.

**Please note**: There is a known issue where this configuration may only work for a few hours. If you encounter this, try restarting your computer to restore functionality. You can read more about this issue [here](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4126#issuecomment-1960956749).

## And That’s It!

Now you're ready to use the zoom-to-mouse functionality in OBS Studio. Simply press '1' to zoom in and out, and '2' to toggle the zoom following your mouse. This feature can help make your tutorials, presentations, or streams more engaging.
